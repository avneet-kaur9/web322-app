              Hi! My name is Avneet Kaur. I am currently pursuing Computer Programming Program. I 
              will graduate this year in December. I am  glad that I have been so far in this 
              journey. It was definitely not an easy going one. We have to put lots of efforts and 
              sincerity in order to achieve the goals. 
          </p>
          <p>
              As I am fresher in this field, it was quite difficult for me to grasp all of the 
              concepts and implement them all together. Though, I am keeping my spirits high as 
              there is still lots of challenges to come on the way.
          </p>
          <p>
              If I talk about my background, I am from Punjab, India. I passed my high school 
              in Non Medical stream. Mathematics was and is my favourite sybject. Unfortunately,
              I am not having it in any of my semester in Diploma.
          </p>
          <p>
              Other than this, I love to solve logical problems and also finding solutions in 
              terms of coding offcorse. I love to spend quality time alone with nature. I always 
              like to travel, read books and spread humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
              I am really a practical person. Persnally, I do not like people who cannot sense the 
              emotions of others with their common sense. I like live freely and do what I want. 
              I think we should always embrace little moments of our life and follow your passion.
